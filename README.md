# PROGRAMMING-FOR-PROBLEM-SOLVING-USING-C
 To make learn the basic elements  of C programming, control structures, derived data types, Modular programming, user defined  structures, basics of files and its I/O operations.

Introduction to Problem solving through C-Programming: Problem Specification,
Algorithm / pseudo code, flowchart, examples.
C-Programming: Structure of C program, identifiers, basic data types and sizes, Constants, 
variables, Input-output statements, A sample c program, operators, expressions, type 
conversions, conditional expressions, precedence of operators and order of evaluation. 
Control statements: if, if else, else if ladder and switch statements, while, do-while and for 
statements, break, continue, go to and labels.

Arrays- concept, declaration, definition, accessing elements, storing elements, two dimensional 
and multi-dimensional arrays.
Character Arrays: declaration, initialization, reading, writing strings, string handling functions, 
pre-processor Directives, and macros.
Applications of Arrays: Linear search, Binary search, Bubble Sort.

Pointers- concepts, declaring & initialization of pointer variables, pointer expressions, pointer 
arithmetic, pointers and arrays, pointers and character arrays, pointers to pointers.
Functions: basics, category of functions, parameter passing techniques, recursive functionscomparison with Iteration, Functions with arrays, Standard library functions, dynamic memory 
management functions, command line arguments.
Storage classes - auto, register, static and extern.

Derived types- structures- declaration, definition, and initialization of structures, accessing 
structures, nested structures, arrays of structures, structures and functions, pointers to structures, 
self-referential structures, unions, typedef

Files â€“ concept of a file, text files and binary files, streams, standard I/O, Formatted I/O, file I/O 
operations, error handling.
